# 🚀 Swift Learning

Welcome to my Swift learning repository!  
This repo contains small SwiftUI and iOS projects I’m building as part of my learning journey.

Each project is organized in its own folder and branch, with clean code, screenshots, and documentation.

## ✦ Vision

As a developer exploring the Apple ecosystem, I created **Hello Swift** to:
- Master the SwiftUI framework from fundamentals to advanced concepts
- Build a portfolio of well-structured, visually appealing iOS apps
- Develop a strong foundation in app architecture (MVVM), animations, and native components
- Document and share every step so others can follow along or contribute
- Eventually build production-ready iOS apps and explore integration with real APIs and services

> Think of this repo as my public Swift playground — where each project is a milestone toward becoming an expert iOS developer.
